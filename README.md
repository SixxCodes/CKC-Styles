# üõçÔ∏è CKC-Styles (E-commerce Strorefront Simulator) pure Python üõçÔ∏è

* An E-Commerce Storefront Simulator. 
* Made using pure python. 
* Json file for storing user and product information. 
* Only for school project purposes, not reccomended for practical use.
* IDE: Virtual Studio Code

## üõçÔ∏è This project still have bugs/erros:

1. Image Carousel on homePage_Panel keeps on writing errors on the terminal while program is running. It doesnt affect thhe program at all though.
2. As a seller, when you delete one product, all of the existing products, including products of other seller, gets deleted too. DAMN!
3. My Order glitches if there's a lot of orders!
4. On "My Cart", if you search for a specific product and you select all, then you press "Checkout", all of the products will be written to the Order reciept when it's supposed to only write the ones you searched.
5. If you exit the program, it will reload back.

## üõçÔ∏è Note:
I will not be expanding this project any further since this was only made for a school project. I think it's also very inefficient to make an e-commerce store using only python and a json file as a database. If I will be making an e-commerce store in the future, I will make it again from scratch since programs like that need a strong database and clean codes.
